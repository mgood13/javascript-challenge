This code displays a simple webpage which displays data for real truth seekers about alien sightings. It only contains data from January 1-13 from 2010. But is a good proof of concept.

The main functionality is the filter function. This allows the user to input a date and select "Before" or "After." This will then update the page to display only data before or after to the day input by the user. Both cases output data on the input day.
